An effective DevOps workflow always starts with proper planning amongst the development, quality assurance, and operations teams. In order to achieve a fruitful planning, collaboration is relied heavily in this first phase alongside the use of proper project management tools such as Jira, which aids in managing dependencies, feature requirements, and stakeholders for an overall smooth software development life cycle. Following this is the Build phase wherein developers commit codebase changes to a version control system (VCS) such as Git. Utilizing a VCS allows for better collaboration as it has features like branching and tracks any source code changes within the development team. Next phase would be Continuous Integration (CI). In the CI phase, the code is thoroughly analyzed through Jenkins, wherein quality checks as well as automated builds and tests are executed. This phase allows for early identification of any software bugs during the early stages of development. Fourth phase in the workflow is the Deployment stage. Deploying the tested and approved software from previous phases can now be deployed onto Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure for production use. There are various AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and many more that can be utilized to automate various processes for a more seamless and efficient deployment. Following this is the operate phase wherein New Relic can be used to collect information on the application performance and its overall operations. Upon identifying the software's performance, the last phase which is Continuous Feedback comes in. From the name itself, feedback is continuously collected from the previous phase as this aids in identifying areas for improvement. Salesforce can be utilized in this stage since it provides Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solutions which can aid in identifying user behavior when interacting with the software. With collaboration, communication, and usage of the right tools, seamless implementation of an effective DevOps workflow and toolchain is possible.
