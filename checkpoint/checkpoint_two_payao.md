1. I think DevOps is a necessary however it depends on multiple factors such as size and complexity of the software project, organizational culture, goals, and etc. But in this day and age, DevOps has become more important in the modern software development because of effeciency and effectiveness reasons such as Scalability, Continous feedback and improvement, reduced cost, improved collaboration and communication, and Faster time to deployment 
2. The differentiate of CI, CD, and CD is that CI is the foundation of DevOps which focuses on the frequent integrations of code changes into shared repository. This helps to find and solve integrations problems really early in the SDLC, ensuring that the software remains deployable at all times. Continous Delivery adds on the principles of CI, focusing on the automation of the deployment process to non - production enviroment however CD requires more human intervention to promote changes to production, which gives the organization more contorl over when and how changes are released. Continous deployment is the pinnacle of automation in DevOps which enables organizations to deploy codes changes to production automatically and quickly. In CD, code commites are automatically tested and deployed without any human intervention which accelerates the release cycle, reduces time to market, and gives the organization the ability to focus and respond to the feedback, improvement, and market demands
3. The most challenging part with DevOps would be the cultural transformation within the organization. This transformation involve a complete overhull between the development, operations, and other functional teams, encouraging and promoting collaboration and communication between the teams and having a mindset of shared responsibility. There's also the resistence to change from stakeholders who refuses to give finance to the adoption to DevOps practices which will pose a significant challenge
