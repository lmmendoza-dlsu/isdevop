In your own words, kindly illustrate an effective DevOps workflow and toolchain. You may add images in your markdown file. To do that, the syntax is ![image name](/path/to/image/image.png)

An effective DevOps workflow would follow the infinity model of continuous integration and feedback. The workflow, or at least the simplest variation of the workflow, is:
 1. Plan - The planning phase is where important parts of the project are defined, such as objectives and scope, while also hashing out details for things such as the platform the project will be on, the tools needed and the technologies required to make the project. It serves as the foundation of the project going forward, and ensured that the project does no over or underdeliver in its objectives.
 2. Code - This is the phase where code is actually being built and made, and effort are made to avoid issues and maintain quality.
 3. Build - This is the segment of the process where code that has been finished are committed, and then pushed into the actual project.
 4. Test - This is the part where the build is tested to ensure that no flaws made it past the code and build phases, and ensures that the build has no issues when pushed for release.
 5. Release - A phase that shows that the build is ready for deployment, and the necessary preparations have been made to ensure no hassle comes when its deployed for production.
 6. Deploy - This phase emphasize the act of actually deploying the project. Depending on whether or not the team employs continuous deployment, this phase can be automated or manually done in its entirety.
 7. Operate - This phase involves everything after the project is deployed, such as the maintenance and operation of the project and involves configuring the project in order to ensure its operatability.
 8. Monitor - Constant monitoring of the deployed project helps the team identify any issues or bottlenecks that still made it past to deployment, and is then used as a stepping stone for the next iteration of the projects lifecycle.

And then loops back to 'plan' in step 1.
The respective toolchain for each step in the workflow varies depending on what that particular phase needs, and boils down to something like:
 1. Plan - Google Docs or equivalent
 2. Code - VS Code or any IDE
 3. Build - Git
 4. Test - Git
 5. Release - Kubernetes
 6. Deploy - Kubernetes
 7. Operate - Kubernetes
 8. Monitor - LogicMonitor or equivalent
