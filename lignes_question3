Question 3:
- List 3 advantages of using Docker. 
- List 3 benefits of DevOps framework.


Advantages of Using Docker:
1. Docker containers can be started within seconds because they are lightweight and share the host OS kernel. Faster deployment means quicker time-to-market for software updates and features.
2. Docker optimizes resource utilization by sharing the host OS kernel. Containers consume fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
3. Containers provide isolation, allowing applications to run independently without interfering with each other.
Docker images encapsulate everything an application needs making them highly portable.


Benefits of the DevOps Framework:
1. DevOps practices streamline the development and deployment process. Teams can deliver new features and updates to users more rapidly, enhancing customer satisfaction.
2. Cross-functional teams work together seamlessly, reducing bottlenecks and delays.
3. DevOps emphasizes automated testing, code reviews, and quality assurance.
