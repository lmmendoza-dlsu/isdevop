List 3 benefits of DevOps framework.


Advantages of using Docker:
1. Portability: Docker containers are self-contained bundles that include all the necessary dependencies (code, libraries, runtime) to run an application consistently across different environments (development, testing, production) regardless of the underlying operating system. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and simplifies deployment across various platforms.

2. Isolation: Docker containers provide process and file system isolation, ensuring applications run independently without affecting each other or the host system. This enhances security and stability by preventing conflicts and unintended interactions.

3. Scalability: Docker containers are lightweight and resource-efficient, making them ideal for scaling applications. You can easily spin up or down additional containers as needed to meet fluctuating demands, allowing for efficient resource utilization and cost optimization.


Benefits of DevOps framework:
1. Faster software delivery: DevOps automates many aspects of the software development and deployment process, leading to shorter release cycles and quicker time-to-market.

2. Improved collaboration: DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations teams, fostering a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility throughout the software lifecycle.

3. Enhanced reliability and quality: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices, central to DevOps, enable frequent testing and feedback loops, resulting in faster bug detection, improved software quality, and a more reliable product.
