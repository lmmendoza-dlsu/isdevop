An effective DevOps workflow involves collaboration between development and operations teams, emphasizing automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Developers write code, which is then automatically built, tested, and deployed using tools like Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. This streamlined process ensures faster delivery of high-quality software, with feedback loops and monitoring in place for continuous improvement.
