Advantages of Docker:
1. Docker containers run consistently on any system with Docker, regardless of the underlying operating system. This makes applications easy to move between development, testing, and production environments.
2. Each Docker container runs in isolation, with its own processes and file system. This prevents conflicts between applications and ensures consistent behavior.
3. Docker allows building and deployment of applications quickly and easily. Changes can be packaged in containers and deployed to production with minimal downtime.
Benefits of DevOps Framework:
1. DevOps breaks down silos between development and operations teams, fostering better communication and collaboration.
2. By automating tasks and streamlining processes, DevOps enables faster and more frequent application releases.
3. DevOps practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) help identify and fix bugs earlier, leading to higher quality applications.
