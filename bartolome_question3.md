Docker Advantages
    1. Isolation: Docker allows for applications and their dependencies to be encapsulated which guarantee consistency across its environments.
    2. Resource Efficiency: Compared to typical virtual machines, containers use fewer resources and have smaller footprint since a mutual host system's kernel is shared.
    3. Microservice Architecture: Docker is compatible with operating alongside microservice architectures as developers are enabled to build and launch their services in independent containers.

DevOps Framework Advantages
    1. Collaboration/Communication: A culture of shared responsibility is created through the promotion of cooperation between the different teams.
    2. Increased Productivity: Manual labor is reduced due to streamlining and automated operation which results in workflow being more dependable and efficient in terms of both time and resources.
    3. Risk Mitigation: Lowers the possibility of flaws and vulnerabilities within the production through the identification and resolving of problems as early as possible.
