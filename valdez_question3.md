List 3 advantages of using Docker. 

Docker containers simplify the deployment and operation of a program across many contexts, including development, testing, and production, by encapsulating the application and all of its dependencies into a single package.

Docker containers offer isolated, light environments in which to run programs, enabling the peaceful coexistence of several containers on a single host.

Docker's lightweight design and usage of containerization technologies lead to quicker startup times, lower memory overhead, and more effective resource use.
