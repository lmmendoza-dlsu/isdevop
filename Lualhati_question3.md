Question 3: 
1. List 3 advantages of using Docker. 
2. List 3 benefits of DevOps framework.



3 Advantages of using Docker:
1. Fast Deployment and Performance - One of the key advantages of Docker is the absence of an operating system which in turn allows for faster processing times when it comes to its performance. Starting and stopping containers are also easy and makes deployment fast and efficient.

2. Isolation - With Docker, the user has the ability to generate new containers at ease. This is why it is easy to isolate process and file systems making these containers self-contained. It is ensured that with the use of Docker, applications and dependencies will not conflict with each other.

3. Portability - In the event that a program must be ran on a different system, Docker allows for it to be deployed as long as Docker runs in the said system. This allows for consistency among the environments even if the system is different, maing Docker portable.



3 Benefits of DevOps framework:
1. Accelerated deployment - In practicing Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment, this allows for faster development and testing which in turn accelerates deployment along with the frequent releases since processes are streamlined and automated.

2. Better collaboration - With DevOps bridging the gab between the development, quality assurance, and operations teams, this approach allows for better collaboration since teams do not have to work in silos compared to other models.

3. Flexibility and Adaptability - The DevOps approach allows for flexibility and adaptability since changes are made continuously which in turn ensures that changing requirements can be adapted with ease to meet the client's demands.
