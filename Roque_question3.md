-- 3 advantages of Docker

1. Portability- docker containers can run on any platform that can support Docker. Using Docker is easy and it can help developers to deploy applications in different environments making them flexible and adaptable in different setups

2. Efficient - Docker uses containerization wherein it allows you to package applications and allow dependencies into the applications wherein it can be lightweight and not resource heavy on the system. 

3. Consistent - Docker with the idea of CI/CD allows developers to be more confident that the application would be able to test and ensure that it can run in any environment from development to production. Because docker ensures that it can run on the same manner on different environments

1. Collaboration - In DevOps framework it allows teams to collaborate with one another allowing development, operations and stakeholders to work together. Because in the Devops framework teams are encouraged to share knowledge, responsibilities, and ideas. Allowing to have more a collaborative culture in the organization.

2. Efficiency - as DevOps automates streamlines it allows the organization and the team itself to reduce manual workload and it can eliminate the bottlenecking of codebases in the development. It allows teams to focus on other stuffs such as innovation and delivering value to stakeholders rather than spending time on manual work.

3. DevOps promote the idea of a better Risk Management wherein it incorporates the idea of the DevOps workflow that I have stated earlier continuous monitoring and continuous feedback that can ensure and track the performance of applications and allows the team and developers to respond to the problems and issues immediately.
