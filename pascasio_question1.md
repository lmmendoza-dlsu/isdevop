DevOps strives to enhance communication and cooperation between teams working on software development and IT operations. Simplifying the software delivery process, increasing productivity, and guaranteeing an ongoing feedback loop for continuous development and improvement is the objective.

Planning is the first step in an efficient DevOps workflow. Trello or Asana are used to organize sprints, establish project requirements, and prioritize activities. The Code phase is then worked on in a team environment using Git with the assistance of IDE tools like VSCode. During the build phase, source code is compiled into executable artifacts, a process that is frequently automated by tools like sbt or Maven. The use of testing frameworks like JUnit or Selenium is essential for validating code changes and guaranteeing software quality. Then, tools like Travis and Codeship can be used to package the project in preparation for the release in different environments. The Deployment phase then releases the packaged projects into production servers with the use of tools like Docker, AWS, or DC/OS.  Operational phase includes managing and troubleshooting the application in production. Kubernetes, Chef, and Ansible are popular tools used for this phase. Lastly, the Monitor phase focuses on monitoring and observing the performance of the application in the production environment. Nagios, Splunk, and Datadog are tools that offer analytics, logs, and user experience monitoring that are required for the monitoring phase.
