3 Advantages of Docker

1. Scalable. As more and more hosts access an instance, a new instance can easily be created to accomodate more hosts allowing it to handle fluctuating workloads and ensure availability and reliability.
2. Portable. Applications are easily encapsulated and can be accessed through different environments. This allows developers to build, test and deploy applications across several environments which reduces compatibility issues and maintain consistency.
3. Isolation. Docker containers provide isolated environments for running applications making sure that other applications do not disrupt each other. This also makes sure that the application is secure and efficient with the resource utilization.


3 Advantages of DevOps Framework

1. Faster Delivery. By promoting automation, teamwork, and continuous delivery techniques, DevOps enables teams to produce software changes more frequently and consistently. DevOps  shortens time to deliver to the client and improves competitiveness through automation, optimization of workflows, and dismantling silos between the development and operations teams.
2. Improved Quality. Continuous integration, automated testing, and continuous monitoring are examples of DevOps techniques that assist in locating and resolving problems early in the development lifecycle. Teams may produce better-performing software that matches user expectations, find and fix defects faster, and enhance code quality by automating testing and deployment procedures.
3. Culture of Collaboration. DevOps emphasizes collboration and communication with other teams and organization members. This culture promotes knowledge sharing, and faster decision making and better alignment between teams which results to an efficient work process.
