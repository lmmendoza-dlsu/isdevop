This illustrates a DevOps workflow where both Software Development and IT Operations team work together in shortening the software development lifecycle through
collaboration and automation of streamlined processes to ensure efficient and quick software releases.

Plan - Sprint planning (associated with the Agile framework) where cross-functional teams collaborate and establish tasks that align goals

Code - Development team will write code and commmit changes (ex. Git -- version control system) to collaborate on changes to a repository

Build - A commit change in code can trigger an automated build where compilation, packaging, and testing of code occurs (Continuous Integration ex. Jenkins) 

Test - Automated testing tools help to identify bugs and errors before release to ensure code quality (ex. Selenium)

Release - Prepare code for deployment in the production environment; Document code changes implemented  

Deploy - Automated release deployment to various production environments (Continuous Deployment ex. Docker)

Operate - Operation team will manage the deployed software application, making sure it is up and running as intended

Monitor - Continuous monitoring of the application using tools; Gather insightful data on performance
