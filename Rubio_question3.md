Advantages of Using Docker

1. Docker gives the benefit of being lightweight and efficient as containers share the host OS kernel and only include application dependencies.
2. Docker ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production, reducing the risk of "it works on my machine" issues.
3. Docker provides flexibility and agility in its containers because they can easily be scaled up or down to handle varying workloads.

Benefits of DevOps Framework

1. DevOps practices streamlined the software delivery pipelines which enables faster and more frequent releases.
2. DevOps encourages collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other relevant stakeholders which leads to better alignment of goals and priorities.
3. DevOps reduces the likelihood of errors and failures by automating and standardizing processes.
