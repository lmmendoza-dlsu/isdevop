The DevOps lifecycle can be described using the following stages, often depicted as an infinite loop to emphasize continuous improvement. In the illustration above, it shows each stage and corresponding tools.

Plan: Define the scope and plan out the tasks for the upcoming iteration of the product.
Code: Write and review code, then merge changes into a shared repository.
Build: Compile the code into executable artifacts ready for deployment.
Test: Run automated tests to ensure the code meets quality standards.
Release: Prepare the application for deployment to production with versioning.
Deploy: Move the release into the production environment.
Operate: Carry out the necessary operations to keep the system running smoothly.
Monitor: Track the performance and health of the application to identify issues.
Plan: Use insights from monitoring to inform the next planning stage.
This cycle aims to streamline the development process, reduce time-to-market, and maintain high-quality standards in software delivery.
