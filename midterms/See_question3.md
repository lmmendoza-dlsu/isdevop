For the advantages of Docker:

One of the advnatges of Docker would be its rapid performance. Due to Docker focusing on containeraztion, containers have smaller footprints and is faster to start tha virtual machines.

Docker can also adapt to scalability since it is capable of generating new containers quickly in case applications rise in demand. There is also container management for multiple containers.

Docker provides isolation which has improved security since docker containers run independently wherein one container cannot check the processes of another container. Since each container has its own resources, they use those resources allocated to them, thus gaining more control over the flow.

For the benefits of DevOps framework:

Since DevOps focus on streamlining the processes for Operations teams and overall improve operational efficiency, this provides results in a more responsive and agile IT environment. 

Continuous integration, delivery and deployment have enabled software to be automaticcally updated and rapidly. There is an increase in overall efficiency, collaboration, team communication, and knowledge transfer.

There is also minimal production and management cost as new updates and maintenance are brought under a singl unit, if there is proper collaboration.
