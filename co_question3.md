2. Benefits of DevOps Framework
    1. Increased efficiency - by using automation, there is more time for the developers to focus on more urgent tasks instead of doing repetitive tasks like deploying each change manually, or doing the testing. This means the developers can also have more time instead for collaboration or innovation in product testing/developing. 
    2. Consistency - by utilizing automation, there is less risk for human error which is common in software development and deployment. This also means that bugs or defects in the software will be able to be detected early in the development process instead of only discovering it when it is time for deployment. 
    3. Culture of collaboration - by breaking down traditional silos (essentially splitting the development and operations and quality assurance from each other), it fosters communication and transparency between teams which can lead to better teamwork and a more organized and determined workflow.
