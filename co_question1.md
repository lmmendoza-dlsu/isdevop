1. Plan/Collaborate
    The first step to an effective routine or cycle of operations is always to plan and determine requirements which can be done by collaborating with all the teams and departments that are part of the development process. This is to ensure that everyone has their priorities, expectations, and goals aligned with each other.
2. Code
    The second step is to ofcourse code, the developers will get started with creating the application determined from the initial collaboration process which can be done using Git, which enables the developers to collaborate and share changes made to the software through the repository. This is called a version control system and as the name implies, it makes it easier for the developers to keep track of progress.
3. Build
    The third step is to build the actual code which can be done through automation and utilizing for example, Jenkins, which facilitates the continuous integration process of DevOps through pipelines, monitoring changes, and notifying users through feedback. 
4. Test
    Also related to building, the testing process is necessary to ensure that human error is minimized or resolved and to make sure that the functions are working as expected. A common automated testing tool that I have used and researched is Selenium, which is a great tool especially for quality assurance.
5. Release/Deliver
    The next step of this framework is to now deliver and release the application and this is basically the bridge to finally deploy the product to the users and customers but more specifically, it is to ensure that the application is in its available state and stable form, which can be done through tools like GitLab CI/CD for example. 
6. Deploy
    The second to the last step is to finally deploy the application to end users and customers, and this can be done through the continuous deployment stage wherein automation is used to automatically release code changes to production after testing. A common tool used for deployment is Kubernetes. 
7. Maintain/Innovate
    Lastly, it is necessary to analyze the product, how it was received, were there any things that went wrong along the process or things to improve upon for innovation to ensure that the end users are satisfied. Not only should the application be further maintained, but there is also room for improvement which is done through regular updates.
