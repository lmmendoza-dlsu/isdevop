# Advantages of Using Docker
- Docker containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies making it easy to migrate applications between different environments seamlessly. 
- Docker containers provide process isolation, allowing applications to run independently of each other without interfering with the other containers.
- Docker creates a container to run every process and doesn't boot any OS. Given this, the deployment process becomes simpler and more automatable, saving time and reducing errors.

# Benefits of DevOps Framework
- Faster Deployment: DevOps practices automate and streamline the software delivery process, leading to shorter development cycles and faster time-to-market.
- Improved Collaboration: DevOps fosters collaboration between development, operations, and QA teams, breaking down silos and promoting cross-functional teamwork.
- Enhanced Stability and Reliability: By implementing continuous integration, continuous deployment, and infrastructure as code, DevOps improves the reliability and stability of software systems, reducing the risk of errors and downtime.
