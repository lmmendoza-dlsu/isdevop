For surname_question2.md: Create a dockerfile that creates a CentOS 7 virtual machine and installs a BASIC MySQL database. Basic means no additional configuration file, and I will only be needing the sa user.
Hint: There is an available image for Centos 7 in dockerhub. You can start your dockerfile with FROM centos:7.
Hint 2: Next thing to do is to install the MySQL server. If Ubuntu has apt-get, CentOS has "yum install"...
