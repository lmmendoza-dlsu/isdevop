## 1. List 3 advantages of using Docker.

1. **Efficiency**
    * Docker containers are lightweight and more efficient than its virtualization counterparts. The share the host OS and kernel thus requiring less resources to run instances of each. This allows users to run more instances of container on their machines much more quickly and easily.

2. **Portability**
    * Docker containers are isolated from one another and the host machine. This allows each container to run different versions of software and dependencies, and even operating systems depending on the business requirements. This allows different containers to be created for different instances no matter the environment.

3. **Isolation**
    * Docker containers are separated from one another to ensure that the applications, services, and dependencies installed do not interfere with one another. This allows multiple applications in different instances to run simultaneously across different containers.

## 2. List 3 benefits of DevOps framework.

1. **Faster project delivery**
    * The shift away from the silo culture ensures that all departments of the project are working together. This allows for faster project delivery as the development, operations, and quality assurance teams are working together to deliver the project in a faster timeframe compared to the silo cultures present without DevOps.

2. **Greater automation**
    * DevOps prioritizes speed in the delivery of a project. One of the advantages to utilizing the DevOps framework is the addition of automation throughout the CI and CD lifecycle of the project. This provides greater tests to be used when pushing new changes to software and ensure that all changes are tested and verified before being pushed to production. This also helps reduce the number of manual errors encountered.

3. **Increased Deployment**
    * The DevOps frameworks focuses on quality outputs throughout a projects lifecycle through various principles such as the CI and CD pipelines. These pipelines ensure that all changes are tested before being pushed into the shared repository allowing for errors to be detected as early as possible. Alongside this, it provides faster deployment as the automation of these tasks provides the DevOps team with the ability to deploy these changes manually or automatically to the production environment.
