# DevOps Workflow:

Planning: The development team creates a plan considering the application objectives and customer requirements.
Coding and Version Control: Developers work on the codebase collaboratively, using version control tools like Git to manage different code versions and merge changes.
Build: The code is built into an executable form using tools like Maven or Gradle.
Testing: The built code undergoes manual and automated testing to identify bugs or errors. A popular automation testing tool mentioned is Selenium.
Deployment: After successful testing, the code is deployed to the production environment by the operations team, using automation tools like Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes.
Monitoring: The deployed application is continuously monitored for performance and issues, with tools like Nagios.
Feedback Loop: Feedback from monitoring is sent back to the planning phase for continuous improvement.
