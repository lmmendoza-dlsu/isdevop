Advantages of using Docker:
1) Lightweight. As Docker utilizes containerization, it ensures that the system resources it takes up are minimal.

3) Scalable. Docker is very easy to deploy, enabling users to run multiple containers at a time without compromising too much resources.

Benefits of DevOps framework:
1) Faster Product Delivery. As the framework emphasizes automation and collaboration, product delivery rates will be enhanced.
2) Better Product Quality. As testing processes are all pushed to be automated and integrated in the DevOps framework, better product quality is also to be expected.
3) Better Team Efficiency. As collaboration is of utmost priority in DevOps, teams will naturally bring out the best in each other and allow for more opportunities to catch errors and ensure quality.
