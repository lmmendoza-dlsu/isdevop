## 1) In your own words, kindly illustrate an effective DevOps workflow and toolchain

An effective DevOps workflow would require breaking down the silos between the Dev, QA, and IT Operations teams. To ensure proper observation of CI/CD, implementing it necessitates the use of the proper tools for automation and seamless collaboration. As seen in the illustration, it symbolizes an infinity sign where the process is continuous and cyclical, typically involving the following steps:

1) Plan: Gather user requirements, define the project goals, and plan the development process (with test-driven development in mind).

2) Code: Develop the application/system according to the user requirements and project goals.

3) Build: Compile the code so that it can be ready for testing.

4) Test: Peforming various types of testing, in order to make sure the application/system meets project standards and is free from bugs and errors.

5) Release/Deploy: Release or deploy the code into to the production or staging deployment.

6) Operate: Manage the deployment of the operation and ensure that it is always up and available for users to access.

7) Monitor: Monitor relevant application/system metrics such as traffic and security. 

The tools used in such a workflow includes version control systems (such as Git), integrated development environments (such as Visual Studio Code), and automation servers (such as Jenkins). Version control systems are used to manage the continuous integration of source code , IDE's are use to write code and test scripts, and finally automation servers are used to automate building, testing, and deployment processes.
