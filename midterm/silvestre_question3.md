2. Docker is also **isolated**, which makes for easier management of IT infrastructure since it limits the impact of potential vulnerabilities to affect the whole system.
3. Docker provides **consistency**, as it can ensure that code will run in all supported platforms which helps reduce issues with compatibility.

## 2. List 3 benefits of DevOps framework.

1. By using the DevOps framework, there is an **increase in collaboration**. By eradicating the silos between development and operations, the work can be more effectively done with a continuous feedback loop.
2. The DevOps framework also brings a **quicker workflow** with the help of automation processes and the CI/CD pipeline. Automation ensures repetitive tasks don't consume time and removes room for human error, thus the team can deploy more rapidly.
3. The DevOps framework also provides **scalability** as it utilizes tools such as containerization. With this, organizations can easily adjust the scale of their application depending on the project and optimizes effective resource utilization.
