An effective DevOps workflow involves planning, coding, testing, deploying, and monitoring. Developers use tools like Git and project management platforms for coding and planning. Continuous Integration (CI) servers automatically test code changes, while Continuous Delivery (CD) automates deployment to testing environments using tools like Docker. Deployment to production is managed by automation scripts and tools like Ansible or Kubernetes. Continuous monitoring of performance and feedback loops drive iterative improvements, ensuring efficient and reliable software delivery.
