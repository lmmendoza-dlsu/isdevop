1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
  Yes, I think we need the DevOps framework because as incorporates faster delivery, high quality, and enhanced collaboration and communication to the project as compared to other frameworks.
2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
  Continuous Integration automates merging code changes, building, and testing frequently, catching issues early in the development cycle. Continuous Delivery builds on the continouos integration, adding automated deployment to a staging environment, ensuring releases are always ready for production. Continuous Deployment takes continouos delivery a step further by automatically deploying approved changes to production, streamlining the release process entirely.
3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
  Not considered most but one of the challenging parts, is the transition from one framework to the other. For example, from shifting to Waterfall to DevOps. I think it will take some time to adapt as the Developer might have been used to a certain framework.
