<!-- In your own words, kindly illustrate an effective DevOps workflow and toolchain. You may add images in your markdown file.  -->

I think the image I have attached (taken from https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/what-is-the-devops-workflow/) perfectly presents an effective DevOps workflow and toolchain. The most effective DevOps workflow and toolchain is when each component/stage is complemented by a tool that enhances the team's productivity and each component/stage is seamlessly connected to the previous one. Moreover, the entire lifecycle should be promoting collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement.
