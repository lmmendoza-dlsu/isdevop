- An illustration of an efficient DevOps workflow involves developers first write code and then push their changes to the Git version control system. The code is then stored and managed on GitHub, a Git repository hosting service. Upon each push to the repository, Jenkins, a Continuous Integration (CI) server, automatically triggers build and test processes. To manage dependencies and build Java projects, Jenkins utilizes Maven, a build automation tool. Following this, SonarQube conducts code quality management, performing static code analysis to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells. JFrog serves as the artifact repository manager, storing and managing build artifacts, dependencies, and Docker images. Docker, a containerization platform, is then used to package applications and dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These Docker images are stored and shared on DockerHub, the Docker image registry. Next, Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform, takes over to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. In Kubernetes, pods serve as the smallest deployable entity, encompassing one or multiple containers. Lastly, end users engage with the deployed application, thereby finalizing the workflow spanning from code development to end-user interaction.
