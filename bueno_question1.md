In your own words, kindly illustrate an effective DevOps workflow and toolchain.

- An effective DevOps workflow is one that follows the DevOps Phases, Plan, Code, Build, Test, Deploy, Monitor, and Operate, using appropriate tools for its respective phases. For the Plan, Code, Build, and Test Phases, GitHub may be used because it provides developers with a variety of resources to help in planning in sprints and analysis and coding like adequate version control system. For Build and Test, GitHub provides a way for developers to create scripts and enable automatic building and testing of code for every commit. For the Release, Deploy, and Operate Phases, Kubernetes may be used. Lastly, for the Monitor Phase, Graylog may be used to properly observe changes, informational messages, and issues through logs which will be worked on by the next cycle of the DevOps workflow. Additionally, I am imagining a toolchain that uses the least amount of tools while simultaneously covering all the phases of the workflow because this allows for a more seamless transition between phases instead of having to use different tools for different phases.
