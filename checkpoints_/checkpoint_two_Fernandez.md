1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
        I think that DevOps is important because it allows you to be more efficient in delivering projects. Some benefits of DevOps are faster development, improved quality, and it allows for enhanced collaboration and communication between each teams. It is extremely helpful if you apply it in an appropriate situation. 

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
        Continuous Integration is a software development practice in which developers itegrate source code changes into a shared repository. Basically, it is integration of code changes. Continuous Delivery involves the release of software. It is a further extension to CI as it involves fully automated release deployment. Lastly, Continuous Deployment is a further extension to CI and CD in which it involves automatically deploying everycode change that will pass testing directly for production. 

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
        I think the most challenging part of DevOps is the initial start or shift to integrating DevOps as well as being able to provide a balance between agility and applying proper security practices. The start is the most challenging because if you are used to traditional development practices, you will need to adapt and change your mindset. Security and Agility is also difficult since you have to keep a proper balance in order to be able to develop a proper product. 
         
2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin
