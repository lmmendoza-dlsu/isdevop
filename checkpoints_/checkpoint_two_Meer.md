	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    - Yes, because DevOps fosters a culture of cooperation, communication, and integration between development teams and IT operations, making it essential to modern software development and IT operations. DevOps helps companies to produce software more quickly and reliably by fostering continuous integration and continuous delivery known as the (CI/CD) methods. This results in quicker release cycles, improved collaboration, and increased efficiency through automation. This method raises customer satisfaction by enhancing software quality and dependability and making it easier to adjust to shifting business needs. Long-term advantages include cost savings, agility, and a competitive edge in today's fast-paced corporate environment, even though there can be upfront expenses.

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

    Continuous Integration (CI), which emphasizes the regular integration of code changes into a shared repository, is the first step in the DevOps process. Regular commits by developers enable early discovery of integration problems, maintain a stable codebase, and start automatic build and test procedures to guarantee the code stays functional and compatible.

    Continuous Delivery (CD), which goes beyond continuous integration (CI), automates the delivery of code changes to different environments, such pre-production or staging. Code updates are automatically deployed to staging after passing automated tests in the continuous integration pipeline. The choice of when to release updates to the live environment is still up to the organizations, as the decision to deploy to production is still made manually.

    Lastly, by automatically deploying code changes to production without requiring human interaction, Continuous Deployment (CD) elevates automation to a new level. The time between development and production deployment is shortened when code changes are automatically pushed to production following the successful completion of all tests in the continuous integration pipeline. With this technique, firms may deliver new features and upgrades to end users faster, reduce human error, and accelerate time-to-market. CI, CD, and CD collectively constitute an all-encompassing collection of procedures that optimize the software development lifecycle and promote cooperation within the DevOps environment.
    
	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

    In my opinion the most challenging part in observing DevOps framework is being in a new platform of culture that is new to me but I've used GitHub before but not the way like 
    this it should be. It's like a cultural shift for me because before I was just using social media platforms to communicate and collaborate but now there's a better way to 
    maintain proper communication and collaborate with projects and also to track the progress. Integration for me is where it gets confusing but as I progress in this course I would 
    able to understand how it works and use it for my future job.
