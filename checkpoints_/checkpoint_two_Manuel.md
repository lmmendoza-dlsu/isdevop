1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    - I think DevOps is a necessity in software development as this streamlines the process of software development, promotes collaboration between developers and QA testers,
    and allows improvment of existing software products to be faster.  
2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    - CI automates builds and tests. Continuous Delivery automates release but not deployment. Continuous Deployment everything from builds and test, to deployment.
3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    - I think one of the challenging parts in the DevOps framework is the change in the cultural and organization environment. DevOps aims to break down barriers between different teams, like developers and operations. It also means everyone needs to keep improving and use automation more. Some people might not like these changes because they're used to doing things a certain way.
