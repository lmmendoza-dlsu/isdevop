1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
Yes, we do. DevOps is essential as it optimizes the processes of software development, deployment, and operations, promoting synergy and effectiveness among teams, leading to enhanced software delivery speed 
and quality for users.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
Continuous Integration (CI): Streamlines the incorporation of code modifications into a shared repository on a regular basis, ensuring prompt testing of each alteration.
Continuous Delivery (CD): Centers on automating the complete software deployment procedure, allowing for frequent and dependable software releases to be made to production environments.
Continuous Deployment (CD): Advances automation by automatically rolling out each modification to production after successfully passing all tests within the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
The most demanding aspect of embracing DevOps often lies in instilling a culture of collaboration and breaking down traditional barriers between separate teams. This shift towards teamwork and changing established 
ways of working can present significant challenges during the implementation of DevOps practices.
