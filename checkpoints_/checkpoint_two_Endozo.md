1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    - Personally, I believe DevOps will be highly beneficial as it improves collaboration and communication within the  working environment, consequently enhancing overall efficiency in our work processes. It will be easier for us to track changes made by our team members, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the development process.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    - The three components are known as the backbones DevOps. The first component is Continuous Integration, it's a software development practice where developers regularly integrate code changes into a shared repository, striving to do so early and consistently. Next is Continuous Delivery, an extension of CI. Unlike CI, Continuous Delivery involves automating the deployment process to ensure the reliable release of software to production at any given moment.Lastly is Continuous Deployment, this component pushes the boundaries of continuous integration and continuous delivery to their fullest extent. In here, the software is released immediately whenever the developer makes changes
     

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    - The most challenging aspect of the DevOps framework for me is that it's my first time using it, and I'm still in the process of adjusting and becoming familiar with its practices. This can be connected with organizations that suddenly transition to using the DevOps framework, where members may find themselves unfamiliar with its practices and methodologies.
