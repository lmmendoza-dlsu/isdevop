# 1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
  I believe there is a need for us to incorporate DevOps practices as it allows for continuous integration, seamless collaboration, and secure 
  code sharing which will increase the efficiency and speed of deploying our software applications.
  
# 2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
  Continuous Integration - Integrating source code changes and running automated tests to easily locate any bugs especially when new commits are integrated
  Continuous Delivery - Automating release process through the deployment of the code changes previously integrated into the staging environment and/or the production
                    environment manually
  Continuous Deployment - Fully automating the deployment process into the production environment without human intervention 
  
#	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
  Based on my experience, I can say that a challenge in observing the DevOps framework is not being able to properly utilize 
  Git, a tool to help facilitate the DevOps framework. For the reason that the person, being a collaborator, cannot adapt to the modern tools 
  of source code management which includes the CI/CD pipeline due to lack of knowledge or resisting to adapt.
