# Checkpoint 02: Git Commands Reinforcement


    1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
		In my opinion, Devops is beneficial since it helps in bridging the gap between development and operations team, which has been a problem with other traditional SDLCs. It promotes collaboration and efficiency throughout the entire software development lifecycle. Moreover, it aims to automate and streamline processes which enables faster and more reliable software delivery. Adopting DevOps not only addresses communication barriers, but also introduces a framework that fosters innovation and continous improvement.


	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

		Continous Integration (CI): CI involves regular integration of code modifications into a shared repository. Developers commit changes frequently, facilitating early detection and resolution of software defects. 

		Continuous Delivery (CD): CD extends continuous integration by ensuring that the software is consistently ready for release to production. It involves automated processes for testing and deployment, speeding the development lifecycle. 
		

		Continuous Deployment (CD): CD is the superlative form of software development practice and automates the entire delivery pipeline. It involves pushing code changes directly to the production environment, making updates visible to users.
	


	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

		In my experience, the most challenging part of familiarizing myself with the DevOps framework has been navigating the tooling landscape and practices. As someone who is more accustomed to traditional development or operations practices, adapting to different tools and their integration within DevOps can be a bit overwhelming.
