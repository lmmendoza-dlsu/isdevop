1. 
  **Docker**
    - Docker conatainers encapsualte the application and all its dependencies into a single unit, making it easy to deploy consistently across differennt environment, such as development,testing, and production
    - Docker containers provide a level of isolation for applications, ensuring that they run independently of the underlying infrastructure. This isolation helps prevent conflicts between applications and ensures that each application operates reliably.
    -  Docker containers are lightweight and efficient, as they share the host system's kernel and only include the necessary libraries and dependencies for the application. This leads to faster startup times and better resource utilization compared to traditional virtual machines.


2. 
  **DevOps**
    - Faster Delivery would be first as DevOps practices automate and streamline the software delivery pipeline, enabling teams to deliver new features, updates, and fixes to production faster and more frequently.
    - Improved Collaboration as DevOps encourages this and communication between development, operations, and other stakeholders, leading to better alignment of goals and faster problem resolution.
    - Stability and Reliability would also be one by which automating testing, deployment, and monitoring processes, DevOps practices help improve the stability and reliability of software systems. This leads to fewer production issues, reduced downtime, and better overall performance.
