### List 3 advantages of using Docker. 


1. It is highly convenient to access docker containers across different environments because docker containers already come with dependencies and configurations.
2. There is more efficient resource utilization using containerization and Docker because the containers share the kernel
3. Because docker containers have their own processes and file systems, applications don't interfere with one another and there is less possibility of conflict between these apps and their dependencies.

### List 3 benefits of DevOps framework.
1. At the core of DevOps is breaking down silos and encouraging different teams involved in software development to be more procctive in collaboration and communication. This results to reduced software development cycles and delivery of output at the highest quality
2. The plethora of available tools is most optimized through DevOps because it creates a -- mostly automated -- toolchain that streamlines the software delivery pipeline.
3.  Automated processes makes continuous delivery and deploymebnt possible, thus reducing risk of human error and conflicts. Automated testing allows developers to identify defects early, and continuous monitoring enables the team to promptly respond to changes and and any issues encountered.
