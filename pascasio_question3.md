3 Advantages of Docker

* Efficient Resource Allocation - Compared to virtualization, Docker is more efficient because it uses containerization where application or services can share the resources of one OS.
* Scalability - Docker has the ability to deploy containers across multiple devices. This ability is useful when the organization wants to expand or adapt to high demands to their services or product.
* Version Control - Docker also has the ability to log and record the different versions of an application. This is useful when mistakes are made and the organization decides to roll back to a previous working iteration.

3 Advantages of DevOps framework
* Easier Collaboration - DevOps bridges the gap of developers and IT operations where they are now able to work seamlessly and together. In addition, the development process can adapt to the changing needs of the customer since they are involved in the development process.
* Faster Development - DevOps makes the development of a software faster because the workload can be easily distributed to other members. When a feature is finished, it undergoes automated testing and easily goes to a deployment state and pushed into the production environment.
* Risk Reduction - Automated testing reduces the risk of human-error when it comes to the debugging process. Moreover, bugs are discovered earlier diromg CI, preventing them from reaching the later stages.
