Hello everyone, good afternoon!

By the time we will be using this file, we should have already done the Git Asynchronous Setup --s and you should already have a good understanding of how Git works, how and why Git is important in DevOps, and the basic Git terminal commands.

The succeeding Git exercises are designed to be done independently, and each activity will be graded.

Please read the instructions of each activities carefully. And also, before requesting for assistance, please do you best to do the exercises on your own so we don't miss out on the experience and the learning -- make sure you have exhausted all possible solutions first :) 

"Success is Not Final, Failure is Not Fatal: it is the Courage to Continue that Counts"
