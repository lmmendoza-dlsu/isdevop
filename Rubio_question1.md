DevOps Workflow and Toolchain

1. Plan
    - Agile methodologies will be utilized for iterative development and project management.
    - Project management tools such as Jira will be used for collaborative planning in order to understand user stories,
      prioritize tasks, and define sprint goals.
    - An in-depth list of requirements must be gathered through communication with clients via initial engagements or continuous feedback loops.

2. Continuous Integration
    - Software developers merge or integrate source code changes in the shared repository.
    - Each code commit will trigger an automation of a set of build and test processes.
    - Continuous Integration tools like Jenkins will automate this process and it will make feedback on code quality and issue identification be possible at an early stage.

3. Continuous Delivery
    - After code changes pass through the CI pipeline, they are automatically deployed to testing environments.
    - Continuous Delivery helps in automating the deployment process.
    - Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS CodeDeploy are examples of tools that helps in facilitating containerization of applications for deployment.

4. Monitoring
    - Dashboards and alerting systems should be implemented for real-time visibility into system performance, application health, and other relevant metrics of the infrastructure.
    - Tools like Prometheus are utilized for event monitoring and alerting

5. Feedback
    - Continuous feedback loops will be established with clients or stakeholders involved in order to gather insights and improve the software through iterative development.
    - Surveys, User Acceptance Tests, and Analytical Tools (like Google Analytics) are utilized to collect user feedback and measure the effectiveness of the features of the software or product.
