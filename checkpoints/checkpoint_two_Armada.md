    1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    In the current fast-paced world of software development, DevOps is essential. It's a cultural transformation that prioritizes cooperation, automation, and continuous delivery rather than just combining development and operations. Processes are streamlined, deployment frequency is increased, and software product quality is generally improved by DevOps approaches. DevOps promotes speedier feedback loops, faster time to market, and better agility in reacting to customer requests and market changes by dismantling silos between development and operations teams. DevOps essentially helps companies to produce software more consistently and effectively, which is essential in the cutthroat IT sector.

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    The three components are the backbone of DevOps, with Continuous Integration (CI) centering on the automated integration of code modifications and the early identification of faults during the development process. While Continuous Delivery (CD) makes sure that all changes have the potential to be released by automating the deployment of code changes to testing or staging environments. However, Continuous Deployment (CD) goes one step further and enables frequent and quick releases by automatically deploying every code change that goes through the pipeline straight to production.

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    From my perspective, the most challenging part of implementing the DevOps framework would be the skillset and knowledge gaps. As DevOps requires acquiring new skills and knowledge, such as automation, infrastructure as code, and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices. So, team members may need training and upskilling to effectively implement it.
