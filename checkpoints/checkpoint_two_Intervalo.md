# On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
## 1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

Yes, I think DevOps as a framework and as a concept is necessary for us even in the univeristy setting as projects become more and more complex as we near the
capstone phase. Currently in my ISANDE2 course, the proposed software to be developed for the client consists of multiple modules and features that depend
on the other to effectively perform the expected tasks. To ensure that all features work as intended is crucial. With DevOps specifically, concepts such as
CI and CD ensure that features are deployed as fast as possible which is beneficial when meeting with the client frequently and obtaining more feedbacks. 

## 2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

Continuous Integration is the concept of pushing and integrating changes in the source code as frequently as possible to the repository. Exposing errors in the program as early as possible in the 
development phase

Continuous Delivery is the ability to ready and release the software and its changes to production. This is accomplished through automated building and testing

Continuous Deployment on the other hand is where changes in the software is released to the user as soon as possible, typically accomplished by automating the deployment phase as well

## 3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

The most challenging part in the DevOps framework is having and commiting the time investment to set up the necessary technologies that enable DevOps and CI/CD.
As discussed in lectures, each phase in the framework have their own set of technologies. An example of a DevOps tech stack, it could consist of 
github, jenkins, docker, kubernetes. This alone consists of a long list of technologies to setup and ensure that each are completely integrated. Most times,
a DevOps tech stack would be fitted into an existing software development project rather than the other way around as project teams start looking into utilizing the framework
and this can take time ensuring that it interfaces with the project properly.
