1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    I do believe that DevOps has become an integral aspect of software development. Its principle of blurring the line between Development and Operations proves to be a more efficient way to deliver quality outputs to clients. It also opens the opportunity to utilize different tools (such as for automated testing) which decreases the time for various steps in the process. This consequentially decreases overall turnaround time and streamlines the process overall.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    CI, CD, and CD formulate the backbone of DevOps.
    Continuous Integration involves integrating source code changes into a shared repository several times in a day.
    Continuous Delivery entails that a software is ready to be released to production at any time. 
    Continuous Deployment is a superlative of CI and CD. Through Continuous Deployment, software is already released to production as soon as changes are integrated via automation.


3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    A possible hurdle that businesses can face when migrating to DevOps experiencing the learning curve when it comes to utilizing the different tools that come with DevOps. In this case, it is important to understand these are just aids for our work, and that we should not be intimidated by the plethora of tools that we can use, but rather appreicate the benefits it returns especially in terms of costs and efficiency.
