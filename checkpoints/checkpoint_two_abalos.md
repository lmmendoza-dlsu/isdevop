1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
	// The concept of DevOps is indeed important since it makes the process of development and deploying applications faster and in a more organized manner. 
	
	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
	// Continuous integration is the process of merging code versions of developers working on a certain project. Basically, it is used to join (merge) all necessary changes.
	// Continuous delivery is the process that streamlines the process of delivering updates/code updates 
	// Continuous deployment is the process that also streamlines the process of deployment after various testing. 
	
	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
	// The most challenging part of DevOps would be adjusting to the different tools introduced to manage automation and collaboration. Since the concept of DevOps as well as using 
	the different tools are very much new to me, it has indeed been quite a challenge to adjust. With that being said, proper tool selection, integration have been quite complex to learn and would need a more hands-on guidance.

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin
