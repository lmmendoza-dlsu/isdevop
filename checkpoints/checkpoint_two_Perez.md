    Answer:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

    Yes, from my perspective, DevOps is crucial in modern software development. It bridges the gap between development and operations, fostering collaboration and communication to deliver high-quality software efficiently and reliably. DevOps practices streamline processes, automate tasks, and enhance deployment frequency, enabling teams to respond rapidly to market changes and customer feedback. 

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

    In DevOps, Continuous Integration (CI) involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository and testing them, ensuring early detection of integration errors and maintaining code quality. Continuous Delivery (CD) extends CI by automating the release process to make code always deployable, enabling faster time to market and more stable releases. Continuous Deployment (CD) goes even further by automatically deploying every change that passes through the CI/CD pipeline to production, eliminating manual intervention and accelerating the delivery process. 

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    
    In my opinion, one of the most challenging aspects of observing the DevOps framework is cultural change within organizations. DevOps requires a shift in mindset, collaboration, and transparency among traditional development and operations teams. This cultural change involves breaking down barriers, fostering a mindset of shared responsibility. Resistance to change or lack of understanding can impede the adoption of DevOps practices
