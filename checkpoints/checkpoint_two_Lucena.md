1. Do we really need DevOps?
    DevOps is essential for maintaining structure and a continuous flow of progress in a team of developers (this includes software engineers, QA, and IT Operations). Although the technology of the modern world DID develop and progress without the existence of the DevOps framework, it would now be a HUGE challenge, an impossibility, if we simply continue without it. In the era of cloud and distributed computing, ever-developing Artificial Intelligence, and data mining, DevOps offer a stability, integrity, and camaraderie simply not offered by other Software Development Lifecycle. Its approach to collaboration and automation is crucial to the development of today's technologies. 
2. What are the differences between CI, CD, and CD?
    The main differences between the three has to do with both the manual/automated approach and phase of the development cycle where they occur. Continuous Integration simply automatically integrates code to the shared repository which improves code-sharing and error detection. Continuous Delivery automates testing and deployment but manually releases to production. Continuous Deployment is an extension and improvement of Continuous Delivery in away that it also automates deployment to production.
3. What could be the most difficult part of observing DevOps framework?
    The challenge in observing DevOps framework has nothing to do with its technical aspects; rather, it has to do with resistance to change and cultural shift. As a starting programmer, most college machine projects follow a waterfall method. Once we were taught DevOps, the principles and practices we've learned from our earlier years of using waterfall method still manifests in our DevOps framework, which often lead to impairment and backlogs.
