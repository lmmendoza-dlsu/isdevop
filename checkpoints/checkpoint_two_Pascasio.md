1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
        Yes because DevOps bridges the gap between IT Operations and the software developers, which fosters more efficient software delivery. DevOps allows quicker releases and improved software quality through automation and continuous integration. In comparison to Waterfall method that follows a linear approach, where each phase must be completed before proceeding, DevOps streamlines the process for a much more efficient development, deployment, and testing process.
	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
		Continuous Integration (CI) helps developers automatically integrate their code changes, which helps in catching and fixing bugs early in the development process. Continuous Delivery (CD) automates the process of preparing code for various environments. It ensures that software is always in a deployable state. Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically deploys the changes to production. This step enables faster releases, early issue detection, and automated deployment.

    
	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
		As we are currently experiencing, the most challenging part of DevOps is probably the adaptation to the shift to DevOps. We are often used to performing things manually from our old programming subjects. Now that we are learning about DevOps, it is exciting but also quite overwhelming to learn given the various tools and steps needed to set it up.

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin
