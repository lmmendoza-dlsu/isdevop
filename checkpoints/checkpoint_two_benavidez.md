1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint*one, create a new file named checkpoint_two*<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:

   1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
      Yes, I think we need DevOps becauase it can help us to save time from repeated works. DevOps makes it easier for developer to automate the tasks and let them focus more on their coding tasks. It also enhanced the collaboration between different team and makes things more efficient that the traditional way. When we implement automated testing and deployment pipelines, DevOps help us to find bugs and issues early in the development process which will ensure the quality of the software.
   2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
      CI/continous integration is the practice where developers put their codes into a shared repository like Github and then it will trigger an automated process to test the code.CD/continous delivery extend the CI and focus on the release of the software. It will automatically deploy the code to the testing environment but it will require a manual interaction to deploy to production environment. CD/continous deployment automate everything including the deployment to production.
   3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
      I think the most challenging part is DevOps require knowledge and skills of new tools set. Both the developer team and operation teams need to learn new technologies, automation tools, and practices. It also needs the teams to be trained on how to utilize DevOps principles and tools.

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
   git add <filename>
   git commit -m "meaningful" message
   git push origin

//NOTE: Kindly follow coding/scripting best practice when doing the activity
