1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
Yes, we need DevOps because using DevOps will make the process of developing and operating easier and smoother. It can also eliminate errors and bugs at an early stage of development. Moreover, its automation increases the efficiency of the development process and minimizes human errors.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
CI means continuous integration which is about developers combining their code changes into a shared repository. It also triggered actions such as testing and building when the code is changed on the repository. CD stands for continuous delivery which automates some of the processes and manually releases the software. Another CD means continuous deployment which automates all the processes of releasing the software to the customers to make sure the code can be delivered to customers quickly. 

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
For me, the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework will be the learning and using of the different tools and software. Learning these tools requires a lot of time and practice which can slow down the efficiency of using DevOps.
