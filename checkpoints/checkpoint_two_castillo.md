1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    - Yes. Without DevOps, the development and operations team will be working inefficiently as DevOps is a set of practice that automates the processes between software development and IT teams. Building, testing, and deploying software can be done more quickly, frequently, and reliably with DevOps.
2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    - CI or Continuous Integration is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple developers into a single project. As an example, 3 developers are assigned to work on a project and this project has been created in Github. Each developer will have their own branch to work on, once they're done with their part, they will create a pull request to merge their code the the main branch. This is where Continious integration comes in, automated tests will be run to test the code and identify bugs.
    - CD or Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically preparing the code for release to production.
    - CD or Continuous Delivery, similarly, it is the practice of automatically testing the code. It will only accept the lines of code that passed the tests.
3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    - The most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework is the massive learning gap for those people who are used to the traditional practice of software development as DevOps consists of a lot of tools and practices that may be overwhelming for some. It requires time and effort to learn and understand the purpose of each tools and why some practices are considered standard in DevOps. Overall, it is a big change which can be challenging for some people especially those who are not open to change.
