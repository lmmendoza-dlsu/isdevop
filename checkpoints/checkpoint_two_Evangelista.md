1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
        We need DevOps because it streamlines software delivery procedures, allowing businesses to roll out features and upgrades more quickly and consistently. Additionally, DevOps promotes collaboration and communication, leading to smoother workflows and better outcomes. 

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
        Continuous Integration (CI) automates the process of merging code changes into a shared repository and conducting automated tests to identify errors at an early stage in the development cycle. Continuous Delivery (CD) complements CI by automating the deployment of code changes to staging or production environments post successful integration, facilitating swift and dependable software releases. Continuous Deployment (CD) takes this a step further, automatically pushing all code changes that clear the CI/CD pipeline directly to production environments, expediting time-to-market while minimizing manual intervention.

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
        So far I have no challenging experience yet with DevOps. However, I think I will have a hard time with managing diverse array of tools and technologies involved in DevOps like version control systems.


2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin
