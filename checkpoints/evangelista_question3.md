# List 3 advantages of using docker, and 3 benefits of Devops framework
---
## Answer:
Advantages of using Docker:

1.Docker containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run, including libraries and dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
2.Docker provides lightweight, isolated containers that enable developers to package applications with all their dependencies, avoiding conflicts with other applications or system configurations.
3.Docker containers can run on any infrastructure that supports Docker, whether it's a developer's local machine, on-premises servers, or cloud environments, providing portability and flexibility in deployment.

Benefits of DevOps framework:

1.DevOps promotes collaboration and automation, enabling teams to release software more frequently and reliably, reducing time-to-market for new features and updates.
2.By integrating continuous testing and automated deployment practices, DevOps fosters a culture of quality assurance throughout the development lifecycle, leading to fewer defects and higher customer satisfaction.
3.DevOps breaks down silos between development and operations teams, streamlining processes and improving communication. This leads to greater efficiency in development, deployment, and operations, ultimately enhancing overall productivity and business outcomes.
