1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

    - I think that in todays fast paced world, we really need DevOps in order to make sure that we eliminate the silos that exists within different departments. By being able to fully utilize the benefits of DevOps, we will be able to most effectively and efficiently collaborate and develop whatever software is required. It is also the foundation for implementing CI/CD, which greatly lowers product delivery time and increases product quality.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

    - The three components of DevOps are the following:    
        - Continuous Integration (CI)
            - is a software development practice where developers have a shared code repository that they all integrate their souce code changes to. In this shared repository, the automated process of building, testing, and verification of the code change is possible. 
        - Continuous Delivery (CD)
            - is the next step after Continuous Integration, which covers all of the formers previous process. It allows for fully automated release deployment. This means that once the shared repository has passed all the automated stages, it could be deployed into stage automatically, then manually deployed into production. 
        - Continuous Deployment (CD)
            - is the next step after Continuous Delivery. In Continuous Delivery, deployment into production has to be done manually. But in Continuous Deployment, the code is being deployed into production as soon as any change is produced by the developer (after it passes automated testing). 

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

    - I think that its initial implementation could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework, because of how much processes will be changing. While DevOps promises to streamline processes and make life easier for everyone involved, transitioning to this new approach would mean having to go out of your comfort zone, learn new tools, and adapt to the framework's requirements. I can definitely see that there might be some resistance to change here, especially when old habits go against the framework.
