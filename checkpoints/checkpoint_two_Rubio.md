1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

Yes, we really need DevOps when it comes to prioritizing the needs of consumers. When it comes to delivering software, it is known that Agile is a methodology that is often practiced because of the consumer needs fitting the Agile methodology at times, hence DevOps is needed because it is complementary to Agile and enhances it. Moreover, integrating development, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes will result to enablingfaster and more reliable software delivery, in which it becomes possible to meet the evolving demands of consumers in today's market of digital needs.


2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

Continuous Integration is where developers integrate source code changes into the shared repository as early and often as possible, while Continuous Delivery is where code changes are always ensured to be in a releasable state, with automated build, test, and validation processes, and Continuous Deployment is where uploaded code changes are "delivered" or pushed to the production environment, and it has reflected onto the users. The difference in each is that Continuous Integration is focused on building the software (i.e. software development or integrating code changes in its version control system), while Continuous Delivery and Continuous Development are both similar in their respective process, it's just that Continuous Delivery has a manual step in its deployment, while Continuous Deployment is already automated in that regard. Continuous Delivery has to take place first before Continuous Deployment wherein that manual step of deployment from Continuous Delivery is where Continuous Deployment will be building upon. And then every code change that passes through the Continuous Delivery pipeline will now be automatically deployed to product without much human intervention.


3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

I think the most challenging part of the DevOps framework would be fostering a cultural shift within organizations that are new to or are yet to adopt the DevOps framework. This is because adopting DevOps requires breaking down silos between development, operations, and other departments in order to ensure consistent communication and collaboration. And these can be difficult to achieve and can be met with resistance or reluctance to change, especially in larger organizations with established processes and hierarchies, given that traditional SDLCs are still being practiced until now.
