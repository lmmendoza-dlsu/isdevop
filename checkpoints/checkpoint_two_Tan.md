1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

    Yes, I believe that DevOps is really needed in software development nowadays. It helps developers have enhanced collaboration, efficiency, scalability, and reliability and have shorter development cycles. Furthermore, the quality produced would be of quality even if it was produced at a shorter amount of period. It could also help companies stay competitive in the market nowadays as they can adapt to how fast technology is changing. With how fast technology is developing and adapting, it is also important to have a mindset of continuous learning, which is present in DevOps as one of its focuses would be a culture of continuous learning. Moreover, DevOps would also foster innovation through the use of feedback loops, data analysis, and more, which makes it easier for them to identify areas for innovation. 

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

    CI, also known as Continuous Integration, in DevOps, is the process wherein developers would regularly add changes or updates to the shared repository. This is done to have an early test and validation of the code changes during the development process, which would help lessen integration problems. CD, also known as Continuous Delivery, is the extension of Continuous Integration, which would immediately deploy all the changes in the code to the production of the different environments. Lastly would be continuous deployment, also known as CD, which 
    expands the idea of continuous deployment. All changes that were made would be manually and automatically deployed to the production once it has passed the automated testing. Both continuous integration and continuous delivery build and do automated tests, but continuous delivery has more steps, which are the deployment to the stage and manual deployment to production. On the other hand, continuous deployment is almost similar to continuous delivery with the difference that it is automatically deployed to production. 

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

    In my opinion, the most challenging aspect when observing the DevOps framework would most likely be its change of culture. When coding for a project, way back then, there would be an individualistic approach where individuals do their tasks alone, but this is not encouraged in DevOps as is used to break down solos between the development and the operation team. People are also expected to collaborate and have more communication with each other, which others might find difficult. In this case, we could see that fostering a culture of collaboration and overcoming resistance to change would be crucial for a successful DevOps implementation.
