1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
Yes, I believe that we do need DevOps. DevOps allows for a more seamless and effective way of development, testing, and actually having the system or application be used by users. Because of the classes and projects I have in DLSU, I was able to experience the process of coding, testing, and deploying in a small scale with only 3-6 groupmates. Even with such a small group, we already encountered difficulties when it came to integration, testing, and deployment. I can only imagine how much more difficult that would be to excute on a larger scale, in which many of the companies now are doing so. Thus, DevOps provides a framework that aids individuals in collaboratively working together and being able to deploy applications and systems effectively. 

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
Continuous integration is the practice of integrating changes to code as early and as often as possible to shared repositories. This would ensure that everyone working collaboratively would have access to the latest code and would be able to address any issues early on. Once the code has been deemed by developers to be good and without any issues, it can now be delivered (continuous delivery) by deploying this code in an automated manner to the statging environment. Lastly, continuous deployment is when these changes are then deployed to production, where they can now be seen by users. 

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
The most challenging part of oberving the DevOps framework would be regulating the framework and ensuring that all individuals abide to it. At the end of the day, a framework or process is only as good and effective as the inidviduals actually performing it. When this framework is first introduced there may be negative feelings towards it and a period of adjustemnt which may slow down the adoption process. When this framework is adopted full time, there may still be individuals who commit errors in applying the framework thus messing up the process since those who are abiding by it may also need the changes done by the individual who has committed errors.
