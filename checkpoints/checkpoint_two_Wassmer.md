# Checkpoint 02: GitKraken and Branching
## Questions:
1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
* Yes. With the uprise of technological advancements and requirements for software development, the need for DevOps becomes clear. DevOps allows for a more streamlined process in software development, allowing for a more cohesive and collaborative workflow in completing a project. With the DevOps framework, it becomes easier to manage, work, and maintain a project due to the absence of silos within departments. Alongside this, due to the presence of automation within the project, it also allows developers and operations to automate smaller tasks to prioritize their focus on more important tasks within the project. DevOps allows the project to be integrated and deployed faster due to the CI, CD, and CD components within project implementation. Overall, the benefits provided by implementing the DevOps framework is crucial to maximize resources, budget, and time allocations within a project.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
* Among the three components, each play a significant role within the DevOps framework, allowing for shorter wait times between testing, building, and deploying. CI, also known as Continuous Integration, allows developers to keep their source code up-to-date at all times. Alongside this, to ensure that all code pushed to this shared repository is maintained, developers may also include automation unit tests for the pushed code to ensure functionality at all times. CD, also known as Continuous Delivery, ensures that the pushed software code is ready to be released to production at any time. However, this needs to be manually checked or deployed. Moving on to the next CD, Continuous Deployment, is an extension of Continuous Delivery, with the addition of automated deployment to production. While there are three (3) components discussed, each component also works towards a similar goal of making the integration, build, and deployment process of a project more streamlined.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
* The most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework definitely arises from the change of culture within the organization. With DevOps, it becomes a more cohesive project with all members involved throughout the project. While this allows for more collaboration and a streamlined process in accomplishing a project, there are also cultural changes that employees must adapt to when abiding by this framework in their workflow. From my experience in my group works in university so far, the go-to method for the workflow would often be to assign tasks at the project start and combine our works near the project end. While this works, it becomes difficult to merge all our works together into one project, often becoming more difficult to manage later on. With DevOps, it is clear that continuously making progress to the project, rather than merging it all at once, becomes a better option when collaborating with peers. Overall, the cultural change of shifting to the DevOps framework becomes the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework due to the change in workflow and culture, and adapting to this throughout the project's lifespan.
