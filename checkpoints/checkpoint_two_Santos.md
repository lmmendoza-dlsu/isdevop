# Do we really need DevOps?
Yes! In the software industry, it often highlights the developers and software engineers but DevOps engineers also deseve the same level of recognition. DevOps is a crucial part of software development as it bridges the gap between development and IT Ops. Moreoever, an organization or team can have the most elegant and efficient code, but it becomes futile when it is not delivered and deployed effectively. The significance of DevOps is non-negotiable. 

# The Difference Between CI, CD (Cont. Delivery), CD (Cont. Development)

## Continuous Integration (CI) 
CI ensures that defects are detected and addressed early in the development cycle, leading to faster development speed and higher software quality. I Think of CI as a well-oiled machine in a busy kitchen where chefs continuously add ingredients to a recipe, mix them together, and taste-test the dish. Each time an ingredient is added, the chef ensures that it blends well with the existing flavors, adjusting as necessary. 

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
Continuous Delivery (CD) extends the principles of CI by ensuring that software is always ready for release to production. Conversely, CD acts as a smoothly paved highway with multiple lanes leading  to a destination. Each lane represents a different version of the software, and vehicles (code changes) can seamlessly travel from the development area to the destination (production) without encountering any roadblocks.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)
Continuous Deployment (CD) is the superlative form of software development practice (CI and CD). In continuous deployment, software changes are automatically released to production as soon as they are produced by developers. it is comparable to a high-speed train system (unlike LRT/MRT in the Philippines)that operates around the clock, transporting passengers (software changes) from one station (development) to another (production) in a matter of minutes. 

# My Learnings so Far
So far I have grasped the concept of DevOps since it was just a buzz word for me prior to this class. Another important insight I had was the distinction between CI, Cont. Delivery and Cont. Deployment. The most difficult part of the framework for me would be Cont. Deployment since it has to go through automated testing and has to pass integration tests. Easier said than done, but when the pipeline has the ability to do continuous deployment, it can reduce development time and save costs for the organization.
