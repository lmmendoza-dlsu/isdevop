1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

    DevOps has the potential to alleviate problems in the development in ways that the normal framework couldn't. It serves as the bridge in the gap between teams and operations that serves as the foundation of its purpose, resulting into a very productive and disciplined environment. 

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

    Continuous Integration is a dev practice where developers integrate their source code as early and as often as possible. Continuous Delivery serves as an extension to CI where it continues the integration. Lastly, Continuous Deployment is the superlative extension of the two. 

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

    So far, it's getting the work done. Before I'd always end up not being productive yet with this framework, it really tries to push developers to be active and compliant.

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin


//NOTE: Kindly follow coding/scripting best practice when doing the activity
