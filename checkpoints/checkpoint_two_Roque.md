1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
        Yes in my opinion we need DevOps because in the current pace of our technology time is important through the usage of DevOps it helps developers and more importantly organizations to manage effectively to test and deploy their software or applications to users faster. Also DevOps promote developers and organizations to collaborate closely with teams such as operations, quality assurance. DevOps ensures that the software development lifecycle (SDLC) coordinated and efficient. 

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
        CI is where it focuses on integrating different code changes within different developers into a shared repository one example is using Git which is a version control system wherein multiple developers are working on their code changes and upload it to a specific repository. CI promotes collaboration within developers ensuring an efficient workload. CD(elivery) purpose is to  automate the process wherein the software is being automated from CI. CDelivery is wherein it improves the time and reduces the effort to release updates and makes it for the users to have a faster feedback. While CD(eployment) is wherein the automation is automated wherein the code is automatically deployed in the production after passing all tests. It helps organizations and developers to deliver their updates to users/customers faster, reliably and more importantly efficiently. 
	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
        
        In my opinion I think the most challenging part of DevOps framework would be Continous Deployment because it requires an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the framework because in Deployment it now involves the automation of deployment of code changes after passing all tests and checks. One of the main challenges here is to pass all tests and checks such as bugs because if it was not properly checked and there are bugs it would deter the users to make use of the software correctly. Organizations and developers must provided a robust testing and more importantly user acceptance tests to identify the users problems and improvement regarding the software before deploying the code changes automatically.

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin
