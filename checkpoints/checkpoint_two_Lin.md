    1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

    Yes. DevOps is essential for bridging the gap between development and operations. It enables faster releases and smoother workflows. Traditional ways often neglect operations, leading to bottlenecks in the release process. DevOps addresses this issue by fostering collaboration and streamlining the entire development lifecycle.

    2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    
    Continuous Integration(CI) focus on integrating code changes into a shared repository to detect the errors in an early stage. Continuous Delivery allows teams to manually release software to production. Continuous Deployment is similar to Continuous delivery but there are tools to help automate the process.

    3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

    In my opinion, the most challenging aspect of implementing the DevOps framework is likely the adoption of new tools and practices. This requires the team to learn unfamiliar technologies and collaborate effectively to integrate them into their workflow.
