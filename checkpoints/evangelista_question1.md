# Illustrate and effective Devops workflow

## Answer:
An effective DevOps workflow involves continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Developers commit code changes to a version control system like Git, triggering automated tests and builds through tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI. Upon successful testing, the code is automatically deployed to staging environments for further validation before reaching production. Monitoring and feedback loops are integral, ensuring rapid detection and resolution of any issues in production environments.
