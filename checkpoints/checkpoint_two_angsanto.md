1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    - We need DevOps because of its efficiency in terms of the close collaboration between the development team and the operations team. Without DevOps, delivery of solutions would take longer since the teams would have to wait for each other before working on the project. 

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    - Continuous Integration (CI):  changes in the source code are immediately/often added by the developers
    - Continuous Delivery (CD):     any changes in the source code are MANUALLY deployed
    - Continuous Deployment (CD):   any changes in the source code are AUTOMATICALLY deployed

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    - Some challenges I experienced were learning the new concepts and (honestly) familiarizing myself with GitHub since I seldomly used it during my first few terms in college.
