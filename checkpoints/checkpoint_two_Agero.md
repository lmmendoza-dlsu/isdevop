	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    
    In the past, organizations used traditional methods and have flourished in the industry. I think that DevOps is not necessarily needed as organizations are still able to deliver without the application of DevOps. However, this does not mean that DevOps should be disregarded because it has been a reliable framework in dealing with communication and efficiency problems. 

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

    Continuous Integration - is a practice of integrating or compiling source code changes from developers in one shared repository. This allows developers to find and solve issues without the source code as early as possible.

    Continuous Delivery - is an extention of CI that automates and ensures that the software is ready to be released.

    Continuous Deployment - unlike continuous delivery, deployment automatically deploys changes in the production.

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    
    In my own experience and opinion, I think that the initial application of DevOps could be the most challenging part. Since it is different from my usual way of working, I think that it will post some challenges mentally and physically. I don't think that everyone would struggle but there will definitely be some people who share the same sentiments as me.
