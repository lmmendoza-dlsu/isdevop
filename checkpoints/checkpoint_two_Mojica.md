# In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    - Yes, I believe DevOps is crucial in today's software development landscape. It bridges the gap between development and operations  teams to improve collaboration, and efficiency. Also, by integrating development, testing, deployment, and operations processes, it enables companies to respond to market demands more swiftly and deliver value to customers faster.
# Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    -  Continuous Integration: CI is the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, where automated tests are run to verify the changes. 
    -  Continuous Delivery: CD is the practice of automating the entire software release process, from code changes to production deployment. It involves ensuring that every code change that passes through the CI pipeline is potentially releasable, meaning it undergoes rigorous testing and can be deployed to production at any time but with minimal manual intervention.
    -  Continuouus Deployment: CD is an extension of continuous delivery, where every code change that passes through the CI pipeline is automatically deployed to production environments without manual intervention, as long as it passes all tests and meets certain criteria.
# In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    - In my opinion, one of the most challenging aspects of observing the DevOps framework is cultural change within an organization. DevOps requires breaking down silos between development and operations teams. This cultural shift can be difficult to achieve, especially in larger enterprises with established processes and hierarchies. Even I can see that it this difficult to implement due to resistance to change. As a student, I've experienced similar challenges in group projects where each member focuses solely on their assigned tasks since this is what we are used to do. However, experiencing DevOps during my OJT made me realize the importance of collaboration and communication across different teams within a company in order to finish a project more swiftly and efficiently.
