    1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    Yes. Because in order to release the work as soon as possible, we need to bridge the gap between development and operation. With the traditional method
    like waterfall or even agile methodology, the operation are not involved. Even though we can make it efficient in integrating the codes, the release process
    still suffers because of the bottleneck.

    2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    CI: Continuous Integration - is to include the changes to the existing work as soon as possible so that the issues can be identified as soon as possible.
    CD: Continuous Delivery - is to release the project or to actually put it in production environment MANUALLY
    CD: Continuous Deployment - is to release the project AUTOMATICALLY

    3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    Since Devops is a combination of practices and tools, there definitely are some tools needed to adopted by the team to get the work done. Some of these tools might
    be not used before and there will be a learning process. It needs collaboration and obedience from the entire team to get involved and adopt the technologies.
