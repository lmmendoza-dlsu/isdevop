1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    Yes, I think we really need DevOps especially to the fast emerging of technologies, we should be able to keep up with it, and if we do not use DevOps it is a lot harder to adapt with the environment. With DevOps, we are able to collaborate and communicate between the development team and the IT operations team which enhances the efficiency of the development process and have a stable deployment of applications.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

    CI or Continuous Integration - This is practice such that developers integrate their source code changes into the shared repository where they can also locate and eliminate the software defects at the early stage of software development. While,

    CD or Continuous Delivery - is an extension of CI where in the software is in a state that it is ready to be release to production at any time. Aside from Build and Automated Tests, in CD, it extends to an automated deployment to stage and a manual deployment to production. Lastly,

    CD or Continuous Deployment - is an extension of both CI and CD to the highest. It is the superlative form of the software development practice where it is actually being released even with any change produced by the developer as soon as possible. Unlike Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment has automated deployment to production.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

    I think it will be challenging within the transition to DevOps framework such that employees might resist to the changes associated with it. Another part that I could think of is the complexity of using the tools needed especially to automate the different stages of the development lifecycle because it is crucial to DevOps to have a proper version control and compatibility to make the framework effective. But based on experience, as long as the person involved is willing to learn and be able to understand the advantages of DevOps, there wouldn't be much of a problem implementing it.
