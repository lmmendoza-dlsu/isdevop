1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

- DevOps is essential in the way we do Software Development today because it is complimentary to one of the most powerful software development methodologies which is Agile. It helps alleviate the obstacles faced when using Agile alone, which does not take deployment into consideration of its cycle and therefore can lead to negative effects such as a slow feedback loop between development and operations, slow issue resolution, and overall can delay the project in its entirety. With DevOps, we can have a framework that takes into consideration continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, all of which are concepts that help solve the effects aforementioned. It lets us have a seamless cycle between development, operations, and quality assurance and make our workflow significantly more efficient.

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

- Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are all software development practices in DevOps with the only difference being the point where the automation stops. For Continuous Integration, it consists of integrating code changes into a shared repository as early and as frequent as possible and has an automated testing process which determines whether the code is ready for release. This has a manual process for staging deployment. For Continuous Delivery, it picks up on where Continuous Integration left off and also automates the staging deployment but is manually released to production. Lastly, Continuous Deployment has a full automated process from start to finish as it automates building, testing, staging deployment, and production deployment as it can release changes which can already be seen by the user.

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

- Upon observing the DevOps framework, I think the most challenging part to adapt to when using this framework would be adjusting to the integration between development and operations since it takes advantage of concepts such as CI/CD and automation. Integration brings a certain complexity as it uses tools which may be a learning curve if not understood and implemented correctly. Even if it would be difficult to adapt to these new methods, it is still essential to accept new practices if it means that you can be able to work more efficiently for the team.
