	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
        I definitely think DevOps is essential because this practice allows for faster delivery, which overall contributes to a more efficient software development process. Combining development, QA, and operations into one continuous process known as DevOps proves to be useful whenever there are issues with the software since this combination has a faster turnaround time. Aside from increased collaboration, DevOps also enhances the quality of the software while reducing the cost it takes to automate said software.

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
        Continuous integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment (CD) are basically the backbone of DevOps.
        From the name itself, "integration", Continuous integration (CI) is when developers frequently push or integrate their changes in the source code into the collaborative repository. This process aids in identifying integration issues as soon as possible in the development process to avoid further issues occuring in the delivery/deployment process. Next would be Continuous Deployment (CD) which is the next step to CI. In this practice, the sofware is now deployable and the actual release to production is manual. Lastly, Continuous Deployment (CD) is when the software is released to production every time there is a change made by the developer. This deployment to production is automatic and is what differs itself to Continuous Delivery.

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
        In transitioning to a DevOps framework, a possible challenge that could arise would be incompatibility of tools. Some organizations may use different tools for development and another set of tools for operations. These different toolsets can hinder the overall collaboration and transition to DevOps due to its incompatibility with each other.
