1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
        Yes, I believe that DevOps is essential to modern software development as it fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, improved efficiency, and better adaptability to ensure faster, enhanced, and more reliable software products to be delivered through automating a lot of tasks in Agile teams, allowing for continuous integration, delivery, and deployment.

	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
        Continuous Integration:
            It is the method of merging code changes from multiple programmers to a shared repository frequently and each time a code is committed (added), automated tests and builds are done to ensure that there are no integration issues.
        Continuous Delivery:
            The practice wherein the state in which the software code is always ready to be deployed. Automated processes deliver code to a staging or pre-production environment where it is manually tested to catch any issues before production deployment.
        Continuous Deployment:
            A strategy where code changes are automatically deployed to the production environment after passing automated tests.
	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
        There is some difficulty with switching to utilizing tools and technologies used in different phases of the DevOps pipeline. Coming from Agile, I am used to the siloed work environment and I believe even large businesses might find it difficut to make the transition (especially with their more advanced projects and workflows).
2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin
