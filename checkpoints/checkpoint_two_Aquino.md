1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
	
        DevOps is significant in a working environment since it provides practices, tools, and cultural changes. It essentially breaks down the silos or communication barriers between developers and operations to have a collaborative environment throughout the development process leading to better outcomes and improvement in quality of final product. With this set of practices, it reduces the errors and time spent in the development process. It also provides a faster and more efficient way of delivering the final product to the customers.
	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
        CI (Continuous Integration) - It is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository, ideally several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. Keeping things updated and integrated is the main goal of CI.

        CD (Continuous Delivery) -	An approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. It has a manual release process at the end wherein manual approval gates may be included before deploying to production. 

        CD (Continuous Deployment) -	It is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment, making changes that are visible to the software's users end. Once code passes all tests, itâ€™s automatically deployed without manual intervention.

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework? 

        The most challenging part of observing the DevOps is the cultural change. It is difficult to change the mindset of the people and to have them adapt to the new practices and tools. It is also difficult to have them work together and collaborate with each other. If employees are uncooperative and not trained well with the correct skillset needed, silos within the organization will be difficult to break down. In addition, tool adoption will be a challenge for new users, especially when tasked in tracking issues. 

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin


//NOTE: Kindly follow coding/scripting best practice when doing the activity
