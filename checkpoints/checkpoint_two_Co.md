1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    In my opinion, while many organizations can benefit from the DevOps framework, there are many other frameworks and practices 
    that many organizations can adapt and emulate according to their own needs and work processes which leads me to my point that while it might not be necessarily needed, it can be beneficial for a lot of organizations especially those who are in the IT industry or prioritize product testing/development/deployment. For example, there is even a new called called NoOps that adapts to the everchanging and fast-paced environment of the IT industry. 

2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
    Continuous Integration - this is when the developers integrate their work in what we call a shared repository, essentially a shared workspace or folder, where the developers can commit and merge their changes immediately to the main branch and is usually built using automation for efficiency.

    Continuous Delivery -  this is when the developers can utilize automation to deliver the code changes to a testing environment so the best way to explain it is it is like the bridge between integration to deployment wherein testing is done to ensure the product is ready for deployment. 

    Continuous Deployment - this is when the culmination of code changes to the product is finally released to the customers/end users and since it is continuous, this cycle continues and faster feedback loop is to be expected. 

3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
    I think the most challenging part of the DevOps framework really comes down to adapting to this framework and work culture, like for example, if an organization is used to the waterfall model when it comes to their work processes then shifting to an agile DevOps framework can require many resources, not just financial wise for new materials/work power, but also in terms of intellect because the employees would have to adjust to this new work culture, they might also need to take some workshops and seminars, and they also need to get used to the new complexities that automation and scripts entails.
