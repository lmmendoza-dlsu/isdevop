# 1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
## 1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
### - Yes, in my opinion DevOps is important in today's software development and operations in the corporate world or even at school since DevOps is a culture that has good practice  that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and integration between development and operations teams. DevOps can make development faster and more agile.
## 2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
### - Continuous Integration(CI): Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of regularly merging code updates into a common repository for automated tests and builds. The major objective is to identify integration faults early so that the product is always in a deployable state.
### - Continuous Delivery (CD): CI is expanded by CD, which automates the release procedure. It guarantees that the code updates that clears the continuous integration (CI) stage are automatically pushed to staging or production environments. Maintaining software in a deployable state, available for distribution at any moment is the main goal of CD.
### - Continuous Deployment (CD): By automatically deploying every change that goes through the CI/CD pipeline straight to production, without requiring the development to deploy it manually, CD goes beyond automation. Organizations can quickly and regularly provide people with new features and upgrades thanks to this strategy.
## 3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?
### - For me, the cultural shift will be the most challenging part within organizations. Since DevOps requires a shift in mindset, where collaboration and communication, and shared responsibility is prioritized in DevOps.
# 2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
