# Checkpoint 02: Git Commands Reinforcement
##  On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:

	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

        - Yes, I do believe we really need DevOps, considering the limitations of traditional SDLCs. DevOps should emphasize the efficient utilization of version control systems like Git, playing a crucial role in reducing development time and enhancing deployment effectiveness. The integration of DevOps with microservices facilitates the development of large applications by small, autonomous teams, promoting agility in the development process. Moreover, its alignment with test-driven development ensures code quality through automated testing. Overall, I think DevOps serves as a comprehensive approach to address the challenges of modern software development, fostering collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement, thereby contributing to more streamlined and effective processes.
        
	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
        
        CI - Continuous Integration, this is a software development practice where developers integrate source code changes into a shared repository as early and often as possible, ideally several times a day. On the other hand, CD - Continuous Delivery, this is an extension of Continuous Integration where software is ready to be released to production at any time. Lastly, CD - Continuous Deployment, this is represents the most extreme form of the software development practice. It takes the principles of CI and CD to the utmost level by automatically deploying each code change that successfully passes automated tests directly to the production environment.

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

        - The most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework for me could be the integration of development and operations. This integration requires breaking down the traditional silos that exist between development and IT operations, fostering enhanced collaboration and communication between these teams.  It may be challenging but this is crucial for achieving the core goals of DevOps, such as continuous delivery, faster release cycles, and improved overall efficiency in the software development lifecycle.
