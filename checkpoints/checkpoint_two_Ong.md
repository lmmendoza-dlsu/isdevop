### 1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

> I believe the answer is not a hard yes or no. It all depends on the business's needs and context. For example, a software company that develops multiple software supporting different platforms will definitely need DevOps to keep up with fast-paced releases. However, many companies may either not regularly release their own software, have strict procedures and are highly-regulated, or prefer legacy systems and processes. These types of companies don't necessarily need DevOps, and may be an overkill resulting in excess cost. 

### 2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

> CI is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from different developers to a shared repository. It involves tracking code changes, testing, and detecting errors. CI minimizes the chance of introducing any issues to the software, and ensures that the software remains in a working state. Continuous Delivery (CD) is an extension of CI where the integrated code is automatically deployed into a staging or pre-production environment for further testing and validation before manually releasing to the users. Lastly, continuous deployment (CD) is similar to continuous delivery wherein deployment is automated but in this case, the software is deployed directly into production, visible to the users.

### 3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

> I think the biggest challenge in observing the DevOps framework is the needed shift of team mindset and culture. Starting is usually the hardest part. The development and operations teams may not be used to working together closely. As such, introducing DevOps means that these teams will not just apply DevOps concepts within their team but force them to extend it to the other teams. With this, polishing the bigger group's processes, workflows, standards, and overall dynamic may become the biggest challenge not just to observe DevOps but also to reap its benefits.
