1. **Do you think we really need DevOps?**
   - Yes, because DevOps is instrumental in streamlining the development and deployment process. It does this through facilitating the collaboration between the software development team and IT operations teams throughout the software development life cycle.

2. **Differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.**
   - Continuous Integration (CI): Is the practice of integrating source code changes as soon and as often as possible in order to find and fix errors as early as possible.
   - Continuous Delivery (CD): Ensures the software is always ready for release and is just waiting for manual approval.
   - Continuous Deployment (CD): Takes the process of Continuous Delivery and automates the release process, deploying changes automatically once the automated tests pass.

3. **Most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework, in your opinion.**
   - I think the most challenging aspect would be the ensuring the adjustment to DevOps for the different teams goes smoothly and giving the teams the necessary tools and knowledge to continuously collaborate with the other departments throughout the development.
