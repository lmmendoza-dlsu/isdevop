1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:
	1. In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?
    
    DevOps is vital for modern software development, ensuring seamless collaboration between developers and IT operations. It streamlines workflows and communication, akin to a well-coordinated team tackling a project together. With DevOps, tasks like code integration, testing, and deployment become automated, enhancing productivity and minimizing errors.
	2. Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.
   
   DevOps comprises Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment (CD). CI focuses on frequent code testing, CD automates the release process, and CD further automates deployment to production. These components work together to ensure efficient and reliable software delivery.

	3. In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

    The challenge in adopting DevOps is cultural transformation. It involves changing mindsets and practices to foster collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement across the organization. Overcoming resistance to change, breaking down silos, and promoting a culture of teamwork are key to successful implementation.

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin
