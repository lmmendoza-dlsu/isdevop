Docker advantages:
1. One of Docker's primary essence is encapsulation. Everything an application needs to run is encapsulated, which ensures consistency across different environments. In other words, PORTABILITY is one of Docker's great advantages.
2. Conflict prevention through isolation also serves as an advantage of using Docker. Docker's containers provides process isolation which means each processes has its own lifesystem and resources thus minimizing probabiltiy of conflict between applications.
3. Efficiency. The glaring difference between Docker (containerization) and virtual machines (virtualization) is that Docker's containerization allows different application to share OS Kernel and resources which greatly minimizes hardware resource allocation and distribution between main OS and virtualized OS.
