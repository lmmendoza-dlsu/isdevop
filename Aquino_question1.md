A well-designed DevOps methodology integrates operations and development teams through an organized toolchain, continuous integration, and iterative feedback. Testing and routine code integration aid in the rapid detection of defects. The development team designed and developed the system application in response to real-time feedback. 

The toolchain streamlines and automates the software development lifecycle through version control, continuous integration, containerization, and monitoring tools. Completing a strategy requires the integration of security checks and collaboration platforms. The insights of operations personnel refine the system as it is implemented and executed. Using an integrated toolchain, this cyclical, collaborative process fosters agility, productivity, and high-quality software development.
