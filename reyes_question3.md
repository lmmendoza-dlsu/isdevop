1. It's faster. Since with its practices like CI, CDeployment, CDelivery, it allows for faster and more frequent releases of software updates.
2. Automation is very crucial in this framework as it allows teams to automate repetitive tasks such as testing, code integration, and deployment. 
3. Since it's faster, this framework promotes a culture of continuous improvement allowing for more frequent feedback and improvement. Collecting feedback from users can help identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions, thus, driving continuous innovation for customers.
