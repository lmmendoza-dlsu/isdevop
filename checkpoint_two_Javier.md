1. On the same folder and branch where you put your checkpoint_one, create a new file named checkpoint_two_<yourSurName> then answer the following questions:

// Question 1: In your own words, do you think, we really need DevOps?

/*
DevOps in my perspective is important to take into account as each stage and process in DevOps fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to faster and more reliable delivery of software.  In today's fast-paced technological landscape, the adoption of DevOps practices is crucial for staying competitive and delivering high-quality software products.
*/

// Question 2: Kindly differentiate the three components of DevOps: CI, CD, and CD.

/*
Continuous Integration (CI):
- CI focuses on the frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository.
- The main goal is to identify and address integration issues early in the development process.

Continuous Delivery (CD):
- CD extends CI by automating the entire software release process.
- Although the software is ready for release, the actual deployment to production is a manual process in CD.

Continuous Deployment (CD):
- CD goes a step further by automating the deployment of the software to production environments.
- CD aims for a fully automated end-to-end deployment process.
*/

// Question 3: In your own opinion, and based on your experience so far, what could be the most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework?

/*
The most challenging part of observing the DevOps framework is often the cultural shift within an organization. Adopting DevOps requires breaking down silos between development and operations teams, fostering collaboration, and embracing a mindset of continuous improvement. Resistance to cesses can hinder the successful implementation of DevOps practices.

2. Once you're done -- Add, Commit, and Push your work to the origin
	git add <filename>
	git commit -m "meaningful" message
	git push origin


//NOTE: Kindly follow coding/scripting best practice when doing the activity
