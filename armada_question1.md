![DevOps Workflow and Toolchain](/armada_question1_devops.png)

1. Plan
    - Defining project goals, user stories, and timelines.
    - Jira and Trello are project management tools used in the planning stage to define tasks, track progress, and collaborate on project goals.

2. Code
    - Developers write, test, and commit code.
    - Git, a version control system, is used in DevOps to track code changes and enable collaboration, while Visual Studio Code, an IDE, provides developers with a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, and debugging code.

3. Build
    - Automating the process of compiling and packaging the application.
    - Maven and Gradle are build automation tools used in DevOps to automate the build process, including compiling code, running tests, and packaging the application for deployment.

4. Test
    - Rigorously testing the application to ensure functionality and quality.
    - JUnit is a unit testing framework specifically designed for Java, while Cypress is a functional testing tool that works across various web browsers.

5. Release
    - Preparing the application for deployment to different environments.
    - Both Codeship and Jenkins automate DevOps releases, with Codeship focusing on cloud deployments and Jenkins offering broader CI workflow customization.

6. Deploy
    - Delivering the application to the target environment (staging, production).
    - Terraform manages infrastructure provisioning in DevOps deployments, while Puppet configures and automates server and application setups.

7. Operate
    - Managing and maintaining the deployed application.
    - Docker and Kubernetes are used in DevOps to package and manage containerized applications, enabling efficient deployment, scaling, and operation.

8. Monitor
    - Continuously observing and analyzing application performance and user behavior.
    - Both Prometheus and Datadog play crucial roles in monitoring the health and performance of applications and infrastructure within the DevOps workflow.
