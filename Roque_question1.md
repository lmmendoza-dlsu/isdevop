## In your own words, kindly illustrate an effective DevOps workflow and toolchain

An effective DevOps workflow revolves around the idea of continuous integration and continuous delivery which is a core component of the DevOps workflow the said image is a
simplified representation of that idea so first is usually

1. Planning this is where teams and developers and user define the project requirements this is wherein the team set the goals for the development cycles it allows team to have an objective wherein teams align their efforts to deliver to the users and to the organization.

2. Code this is wherein the developers write code to implement the requirements that were given and to implement features that would improve the codebase. Usually teams use a version control system such as Git to manage change and to track code logs and to be able to identify bugs which are affecting the codebase itself.

3. Build is wherein the automation of compiling code that are to be prepared for testing and deployment. In build it ensures that the code is compiled correctly and dependencies are working properly. This process plays an important part in the sdlc by meeting the coding standards and fulfilling the project's requirements.

4. Testing this is wherein automated test happens such as unit tests, integration tests, module tests and the like this is to ensure that the functionality, performance of the applications meet the project requirements and also to detect early problems that are to be fixed by developers.

5. Release and Deploy once the code had passed the testing stage they are now ready to be released to production this is wherein the version happens and also to be Deployed wherein now the automation of deployment allows the team to have minimal downtime and reduce the risks with new updates/releases.

6. Operate and Monitor this is wherein the team continously monitor the application that it ensures that the stakeholders the users to have no issues and to provide support to ensure that the system is running properly. In Monitoring the team usually collects metrics, logs to improve user experience this is wherein the bugs and user related issues are to be fixed by the developers to ensure that the user gets the best performance.

Lastly, this framework of workflow revolves around the idea of CI and CD which emphasizes the continuous integration of code changes and continuous delivery to production. DevOps workflow improve the collaboration between the development and operation team to ensure that the quality of applications have minimal to none error. It also allows organizations to be more efficient and to deliver value to users.

For the DevOps Toolchain various tools are being used such as

1. Git - a version control system that allows the team to track code changes during development

2. Docker - a containerization platform that is being used to package, distribute and run applications across different environments

3. Jenkins - automation server that is used for building,testing. It allows CI and CD to be automated.
